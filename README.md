# RM Dynamic – Scalable Automation. Real-World Impact.

Welcome to RM Dynamic, an engineering initiative founded by **Mathews P Jacob** to deliver intelligent, cost-effective automation solutions across industries. We specialize in merging software logic with industrial hardware to build systems that are **reliable, scalable, and tailored to real-world constraints**.

## 🧠 What We Do

RM Dynamic designs and implements automation systems that combine:

- **PLC Programming** – Fuji, Siemens, Omron platforms  
- **HMI Design** – Monitouch, Delta interfaces  
- **Panel Wiring & Integration** – Clean, modular, and field-tested  
- **Sensor & Actuator Control** – IR/proximity sensors, motor encoders, pneumatic systems  
- **Communication Protocols** – RS-485, Modbus, and custom serial logic  
- **Software-Hardware Fusion** – Leveraging .NET and embedded logic for smarter control  
- **SCADA Development** – Desktop and web-based SCADA platforms for real-time monitoring and remote access  
- **AOI Machine Development** – Automated Optical Inspection systems for defect detection and quality assurance
